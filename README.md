This game uses the gyroscope to maneuver the ship. It technically runs in the simulator, but it isn't built for that. 
The best way to play is on a real device.

To run on a real device, open it in XCode, and select the GyroFighter app in the project navigator.
Select the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. Put your own personal team in the  "Team" field and set the bundle identifier
to a *unique* string. This should allow it to run on a phone.

During gameplay, if the gyroscope is acting up, hold the phone in a comfortable neutral position, and touch the
recenter button at the bottom left. This resets the gyroscope.
